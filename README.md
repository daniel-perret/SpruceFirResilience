This repository contains data and code necessary to replicate analyses from the paper titled *"Reducing fire severity and extent bolsters subalpine forest resilience to global change through key demographic pathways"*, by Daniel L. Perret, David M. Bell, and Harold S. J. Zald.

The `code` folder contains an RMarkdown document that steps through data manipulation, modeling, and analyses. The `data` folder contains all data used in demographic models. The `objects` folder contains an ancillary .Rdata object used for demonstrating figure plotting.

*NOTE:* Publicly-available USFS FIA data contain plot coordinates that have been geographically "fuzzed" to protect land-owner privacy and the integrity of permanent plots. Data that are supplied in this repository have been generated using these fuzzed coordinates. For this reason, analyses carried out using these data may give different results from those presented in the main manuscript.
