# SpruceFirResilience

This repository contains data and code necessary to replicate analyses from the paper titled *"Reducing fire severity and extent bolsters subalpine forest resilience to global change through key demographic pathways"*, by Daniel L. Perret, David M. Bell, and Harold S. J. Zald.

The `code` folder contains an RMarkdown document that steps through data manipulation, modeling, and analyses. The `data` folder contains all data used in demographic models. The `objects` folder contains an ancillary .Rdata object used for demonstrating figure plotting.
